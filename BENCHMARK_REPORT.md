## Performance Analysis

### Initialization Performance

The network initialization is highly efficient:
- Consistent throughput: 390K-495K neurons/sec across different sizes
- Scales well with network size
- Dominated by sparse connectivity graph construction
- Not significantly affected by plasticity flag (minor variations due to run-to-run variance)

### Simulation Performance

Simulation performance shows expected scaling characteristics:
- **Small networks (1K)**: CPU cache-friendly, achieving 2,600+ steps/sec
- **Medium networks (27K)**: Good balance, 200-210 steps/sec
- **Large networks (125K)**: Still respectable at 35 steps/sec

#### Throughput per Neuron
The neuron update throughput remains stable:
- Small: 2.6M updates/sec
- Medium: 5.4-5.7M updates/sec
- Large: 4.3M updates/sec

This indicates good algorithmic efficiency across scales.

### Plasticity Impact

Learning (plasticity) has measurable but manageable impact:
- **Overhead**: 25-33% performance reduction
- **Consistency**: Overhead is predictable and stable
- **Trade-off**: Biological realism vs. speed

The overhead comes from:
1. Hebbian learning rule computation
2. Synaptic weight updates
3. Additional memory operations

### Spike Statistics

Network activity patterns:
- **High activity (92%)**: Small network with strong input → saturates quickly
- **Medium activity (59%)**: Medium network → balanced regime
- **Low activity (11%)**: Large network → sparse firing (biologically realistic)

Larger networks naturally exhibit sparser firing patterns, which is more biologically plausible.

## Scalability Analysis

### Linear Scaling
Network construction and simulation show near-linear scaling:

| Neurons | Init Time | Sim Time (30 steps) |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1,000 | 0.008s | 0.011s* |
| 27,000 | 0.066s | 0.150s* |
| 125,000 | 0.271s | 0.863s |

*Extrapolated to 30 steps for comparison

### Edge Density
Connectivity remains sparse and efficient:
- Average: ~21 edges per neuron (radius=1 connectivity)
- Memory: <1 MB per 1,000 neurons
- Sparse operations: Enable large-scale simulations

## Hardware Considerations

### CPU Performance
Current benchmarks on CPU show:
- ✅ Excellent for small-medium networks (<50K neurons)
- ⚠️ Adequate for large networks (100K+ neurons) but simulation slows
- ❌ Would struggle with very large networks (1M+ neurons)

### GPU Potential
Expected GPU improvements:
- **10-100× speedup** for large networks (125K+ neurons)
- **Parallel spike processing**: GPU excels at element-wise operations
- **Memory bandwidth**: Critical for sparse matrix operations
- **Recommendation**: GPU essential for networks >100K neurons in production

## Recommendations

### For Research
1. **CPU**: Sufficient for prototyping and networks <100K neurons
2. **GPU**: Required for production simulations >100K neurons
3. **Plasticity**: Enable only when learning is needed; 33% overhead is acceptable for research

### For Production
1. **Network Sizing**: 
   - Target 10K-50K neurons on CPU
   - Target 1M+ neurons on GPU
2. **Optimization Priorities**:
   - Profile sparse matrix operations
   - Consider mixed precision (float16) more aggressively
   - Batch multiple simulations on GPU
3. **Plasticity**: 
   - Disable during inference (33% speed gain)
   - Enable only during training phases

### For Development
1. **Testing**: Use small networks (1K-10K) for unit tests
2. **Validation**: Use medium networks (30K) for integration tests
3. **Benchmarking**: Include large networks (100K+) for performance regression

## Conclusion
